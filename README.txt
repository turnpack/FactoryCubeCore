FactoryCube Production-Level Code
=================================

This structure includes:
- FactoryCube.Core: Core logic for camera management, HALCON image processing, and scanning.
- FactoryCube.Common: Shared interfaces and models.
- FactoryCube.UI: WPF front-end with camera preview and UI controls.
- FactoryCube.Tests: Unit test scaffolding.

Each module is production-ready and modular. HALCON and IDS-specific implementations go under Core.
